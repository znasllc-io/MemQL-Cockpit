// Package inference decides what a machine needs in order to serve
// models, and says it in one sentence.
//
// It sits in front of everything else in `memql worker setup
// --inference`: the floor verdict, the runtime, the install commands and
// the refusal all come from here, and the person running the command sees
// exactly one of them. THE SENTENCES ARE THE PRODUCT. A refusal is read
// by somebody in a terminal at the moment they are blocked, and it is the
// only thing they get -- so each one names the missing thing exactly and
// names the command that fixes it, and the tests assert every one of them
// verbatim. Rewording a sentence is meant to be a decision somebody makes
// on purpose, in a diff a reviewer can read.
//
// Two rules run through the package:
//
//   - DECIDE IS A PURE FUNCTION OF Host, and that is the whole design.
//     Every platform question -- is Docker there, does it have GPU
//     passthrough, how much disk is free -- is answered by the platform
//     files into Host, so the decision itself is table-testable on
//     fixtures with no build tags and no real machine. A runtime.GOOS
//     inside Decide would put the Linux rules beyond the reach of a mac
//     runner and the mac rules beyond the reach of CI, which is where a
//     refusal that names the wrong package survives to production.
//
//   - A PLAN ALWAYS SAYS SOMETHING. There is no path on which Decide
//     returns no refusal, no runtime and no command: that combination is
//     a blank terminal in front of a blocked person, and it is the exact
//     failure this package exists to prevent. A property test walks the
//     whole cross-product to hold it.
//
// The decision NEVER installs anything and never shells out; it reports
// the commands it would run so `setup --inference` can print them and ask
// (design D2 -- no sudo, no `curl | sh`, and nothing installed that
// nobody approved).
