// install.go runs the commands Decide already chose, and nothing else.
//
// THE LINE PRINTED AND THE ARGV RUN ARE THE SAME THING. That is the whole
// contract of this file. A person is shown `p.Install` and answers a
// question about it; if what then executes is a shell that expands `$HOME`
// or follows a pipe, they approved a string and the machine ran a program.
// So every command is split on whitespace into a plain argv, there is no
// `sh -c` anywhere in this package, and a command carrying any character a
// shell would have treated specially is REFUSED rather than guessed at
// (design D2, and CLAUDE.md's "never sudo, never curl | sh").
//
// Refusing a sudo command is the same rule seen from the other side. The
// refusals in plan.go already tell a person to run `sudo systemctl start
// docker` themselves, and that is fine: the rule is about what THIS
// PROCESS executes, not about what a sentence may name. Nothing in Decide
// emits a sudo line today; the guard is what keeps that a decision rather
// than an accident somebody notices on a production machine.

// Runner runs one install command, already split into argv.
//
// It is a seam so a test can assert exactly which argv ran, in order, with
// no brew and no docker on the runner -- and so a caller that wants to
// print rather than execute (a dry run, the portal's "here is what it
// would do") needs no second implementation of the consent flow.

// exit 3 and print the interactive command (consent), print the plan's own

// "install failed" would collapse the first two, and `--non-interactive`
// in the installers keys its whole behaviour off telling them apart.

//
//   - Its child runs in its OWN PROCESS GROUP, because an app session is

//     sends. These commands run in front of a person at a terminal, whose
//     Ctrl-C reaches the foreground process group -- so inheriting the
//     group is what makes Ctrl-C stop `brew install`, and taking a new one
//     would leave them pressing it at a process that no longer hears them.
//   - Its partial-line flush exists because an app's progress bar has to
//     be chunked onto a gRPC stream without going silent for ten minutes.
//     Here stdout is wired straight through to the terminal, so there is
//     no buffer between the child and the person and nothing to flush.
//
// What is left is short and bounded: `brew install ollama` and a
// `docker run -d` that returns as soon as the container id is printed. A
// pull is the long one, and it does not run here at all -- see pull.go,
// which does not spawn a process either.
