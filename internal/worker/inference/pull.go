// pull.go pulls a model into the runtime this machine serves from.
//
// IT IS AN HTTP CALL, NOT `ollama pull`, AND THE PLAN SAYS OTHERWISE.
// The implementation plan for this epic says "`ollama pull <model>` under
// the supervisor; parses the progress lines". That would work on macOS and
// SILENTLY CANNOT WORK ON LINUX, which is the platform design D1 picked
// Docker for: there the runtime is the ollama/ollama container, and a
// machine that installed it through this command's own plan has no
// `ollama` binary on PATH at all. The subprocess route would have to
// become `docker exec ollama ollama pull`, which hard-codes a container
// name this package does not own and breaks on podman, on a container
// somebody named differently, and on a remote OLLAMA_HOST. The signature
// the plan itself specifies takes `ollamaBase string` -- a URL -- which is
// the shape of the right answer.
//
// The HTTP API is also strictly better at the job. `ollama pull` prints a
// TTY progress bar with carriage returns and ANSI escapes when stdout is a
// terminal and something different when it is not, so "parses the progress
// lines" means parsing a human display that the vendor may restyle in any
// release. POST /api/pull streams NDJSON objects carrying `status`,
// `digest`, `total` and `completed` -- exact byte counts, from the same
// base URL the discoverer already probes, identically for both runtimes.
//
// Verified against Ollama's docs/api.md "Pull a Model" and against
// server/routes.go PullHandler / server/images.go PullModel, all read
// 2026-09-07.
//
// A 200 IS NOT SUCCESS. PullModel emits "pulling manifest" before it
// fetches anything, so the response headers are already sent by the time
// anything can go wrong, and PullHandler then pushes the failure into the
// same body as `{"error": "..."}`. This is the trap CLAUDE.md names for
// the engine's /memql/query, which answers HTTP 200 with the refusal in an
// `errors` array. Every object is read, and the absence of the final
// `{"status":"success"}` is itself a failure -- a runtime killed halfway
// closes the body cleanly, and reading that as a completed pull writes the
// model into models.allow, advertises it to the cluster, and fails on
// somebody else's prompt.

// Progress is one line of a pull, as the runtime reported it.
//
// Completed and Total belong to the LAYER named in Status, not to the
// model: Ollama pulls a model as several blobs and restarts the count for
// each one. A caller rendering a single bar keys it on Status changing
// rather than summing, and one that treats Total as the download size will
// show a bar that reaches the end and starts again. There is no separate
// digest field because the status line already names it ("pulling
// 8934d96d3f08"), and a second spelling of the same fact is one more thing
// for two surfaces to disagree about.
