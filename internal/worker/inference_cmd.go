// `memql worker setup --inference`, plus the --pull / --allow half of
// `memql worker models`.
//
// EVERY PHASE PRINTS ITS HEADING BEFORE THE WORK, never after. Somebody
// who interrupts a four-gigabyte download at second 40 has to be able to
// read off the screen what they interrupted, and a spinner that turns out
// to have installed something is the exact failure this shape exists to
// prevent. The failure the whole file is written against is narrower than
// that: a multi-gigabyte download that looks identical to a hang,
// followed by a machine that still does not appear in the fleet, with
// nothing on screen saying which of the five possible reasons it was.
//
// THE SENTENCES ARE THE PRODUCT, the same way they are in
// internal/worker/inference. A refusal is read by somebody in a terminal
// at the moment they are blocked and it is the only thing they get, so
// each one states the true thing first and then the command that fixes
// it, and the tests assert them. Rewording one is meant to be a decision
// in a diff a reviewer can read, not a tidy-up.
//
// NOTHING HERE RUNS SUDO. Where a fix needs it, the command is printed
// for the PERSON to run and is LABELLED as such -- a line the cockpit
// prints and a line the cockpit runs look identical on screen, and that
// distinction only survives if the copy carries it.
//
// The refusals this file composes are printed to stdout in full, so the
// process exits through alreadySaid rather than through a message the
// dispatcher would print a second time under them.

// pullDisplay renders one model's pull, on a terminal and in a log file.
//
// OLLAMA'S PROGRESS IS PER-LAYER, AND A NAIVE BAR IS THEREFORE BROKEN.
// A model is several blobs, and Completed and Total belong to the blob
// named in Status -- the runtime restarts both counts for each one (see
// inference.Progress). A single bar keyed on them reaches the end, jumps
// to zero and starts again, which on screen is indistinguishable from a
// download that failed and restarted.
//
// So the layers are TRACKED BY DIGEST -- the status line carries it
// ("pulling 8934d96d3f08"), which is why Progress has no separate field
// for it -- and what is shown is the total across the layers seen so
// far. Completed and Total are accumulated as per-layer MAXIMA, so both
// counters are monotone by construction: a retried chunk cannot subtract
// bytes, and a duplicate event cannot add them twice.
//
// THE PERCENTAGE IS HELD RATHER THAN REWOUND. The denominator only ever
// grows -- a layer that has not started yet has announced no total -- so
// a small layer finishing before a large one is announced would drop the
// true fraction from 100% to single digits. That is the same "looks
// broken" failure by a different route, so the bar keeps the furthest
// position it has reached and starts moving again when the true fraction
// passes it. The BYTES beside it are never adjusted: they are the truth
// on that line, and the new total is announced on its own line at the
// moment it grows, so nothing on screen contradicts anything.
