	// On the INTERFACE rather than behind a type assertion, because the

	// Runner.RequestImmediateReadvertise -- is re-advertising on the
	// strength of what the next Models says. An implementation that
	// silently could not forget would hand it the label set from before

// WHY CACHE. Discovery is one HTTP call to list what is installed plus one
// per model to ask what it can do, and it is taken on every registration
// and on every refresh check. Uncached, a machine with ten models pulled
// would issue eleven requests a minute forever to answer a question whose
// answer changes when somebody runs `ollama pull`.
//
// WHY LONGER THAN modelRefreshInterval (60s). The runner's refresh ticker
// is what keeps this warm, and a TTL shorter than its period would leave a
// window in which the cache is cold and the next reader pays for a full
// probe. That reader is usually a model call resolving its model, and the
// probe would land as latency in front of somebody's generation. The
// ticker refreshes at 60s, comfortably inside 90s, so a cold read happens
// once -- at the first registration -- and never again while connected.
