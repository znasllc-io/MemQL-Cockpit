// launch.go is the ONE adapter between the harness clients and this
// package's process supervisor.
//
// WHY AN ADAPTER RATHER THAN A SECOND SUPERVISOR. internal/worker/harness
// forks nothing: every process it needs comes from a LaunchFunc the
// caller injects. That is deliberate on both sides. The cockpit already
// has exactly one supervisor -- process.go: own process group, the
// partial-line flush, SIGTERM then a grace window then SIGKILL, and the
// real unnormalised exit code -- and a second one would diverge from it
// in the way that costs somebody a laptop. A cancel that reaps only the
// direct child leaves `claude`'s tools, and their compilers and test
// runners, running on a machine with nothing watching them; that bug is
// worth having in one place rather than two, and this file is what keeps
// it to one.
//
// So a harness turn is supervised by exactly what a plain run was
// supervised by before turns existed. Cancel, the wall-clock ceiling and
// a lost stream all still terminate the GROUP, and the code the engine
// files the run under is still the app's own.

// launcher returns the session's harness.LaunchFunc.
//
// Every process it starts is registered on the session, so cancel and
// teardown reach it. That registration is a single slot rather than a
// list on purpose: a session's turns are SEQUENTIAL (see runTurns), and
// the two harness shapes are process-per-turn (Claude Code, where the
// previous turn's process has already been reaped before the next one
// starts) and one-process-per-session (both Codex clients, which launch
// once in Start). In neither shape are two children of one session alive
// at the same time, so "the current child" is a complete answer and a
// list would only be a longer way to write it.
