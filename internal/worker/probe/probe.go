// Package probe measures what a local model can ACTUALLY do, against a
// suite the cluster names by version.
//
// It exists because the label is a claim and the router needs a fact. A
// machine advertises `structured=1` because its runtime reports a
// `tools` capability -- a proxy the models package is explicit about
// choosing -- and whether the model then HOLDS to one of this platform's
// own schemas is a different question, answerable only by asking it. The
// engine ranks on the answer (record D4) and gates on nothing, which is
// the right way round for a first release: a probe that refused a
// working model on a bad run is worse than no probe.
//
// Three rules run through the package.
//
//   - A FIGURE AND AN ABSENCE ARE NEVER THE SAME SHAPE. A case that
//     scored zero and a case that could not run are opposite facts --
//     the first says the model failed, the second says nothing about the
//     model at all -- and anything that rendered both as "0" would rank a
//     working model below a broken one. Figure carries one or the other,
//     never both, and Measured() is the only way to ask.
//
//   - THE SUITE VERSION IS A PIN, NOT A FLOOR. Figures are filed on the
//     engine by (machineId, modelId, suiteVersion). Running a different
//     set of cases under a number the cluster asked for would file
//     measurements of one thing as measurements of another, so an
//     unrecognised version is REFUSED in both directions -- newer and
//     older alike.
//
//   - ONE WEDGED CASE MUST NOT COST THE OTHERS. Each case runs under its
//     own deadline. A whole-run ceiling would lose every figure to the
//     last case that hung, which is precisely the case most worth
//     reporting.
