// modelpull.go is the ModelPullStart / ModelPullProgress / ModelPullEnd /
// ModelPullCancel arm of the worker stream -- the cockpit half of engine
// epic memql#5103, shipped under the install wizard's D13 (memql#5218).
//
// THE CLUSTER ASKS; THE MACHINE RUNS THE PATH IT ALREADY HAD. Nothing in
// this file knows how to pull a model. It runs, in order, exactly what
// `memql worker models --pull` runs from a terminal: inference.Pull against
// the Ollama the discoverer resolved, inference.Allow on this machine's
// policy.yaml, and a re-advertise request -- with one difference forced by
// where it runs. The CLI is a SECOND PROCESS and reaches the running
// worker through a SIGHUP, whose handler reloads policy.yaml and then asks
// for the re-advertise. This arm IS the running worker, so it reloads the
// policy itself; without that the inventory's next probe reads the allow
// list from before the pull, the reconnect re-registers the old labels,
// and a pull that succeeded reads to the person watching as one that did
// nothing.
//
// A PULL IS NOT A TOOL CALL. It is not counted in Runner.active, because
// that group is waited on before a reconnect and a pull is hours; it is
// not given a ModelCall concurrency slot, because it competes for
// bandwidth and disk rather than for the model runner. What it shares
// with both is the shape -- a start, a stream, an end, correlated by
// request id -- and the two exits every long-running arm on this stream
// has: the cluster cancels it by name, or the stream goes and StopAll
// cancels everything.
//
// THE END GOES OUT BEFORE THE RE-ADVERTISE IS REQUESTED, and a live pull
// counts as busy. Re-advertising means reconnecting (labels bind at
// Register), and a reconnect closes the stream the End rides. So the
// order is: End, a short settle for the transport to flush it, release,
// THEN the request -- and until the release the pull holds the busy
// guard, so a model landing cannot cut its sibling's download short
// either. The recommended set is a pair; the OS asks for both at once.

// ModelPullOptions wires what a cluster-driven pull needs from this
// machine. Every field is a seam so the arm is exercisable with no
// runtime, no policy.yaml and no network; a nil Pull or Allow is the real
// one (inference.Pull, inference.Allow), and the other three default to
// the permissive reading a build that wired nothing should get.
