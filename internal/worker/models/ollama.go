// questions. /api/tags says what is installed and what SHAPE each one is
// -- its size and its quantization, in the `details` block; /api/show is
// where the context length and the CAPABILITY list live. Advertising from
// tags alone would claim a context window this side never read.
//
// The split matters in one direction: a machine whose /api/show does not
// answer still states its sizes, because those arrived with the listing.
// /api/show's model_info carries a more exact general.parameter_count and
// it is deliberately not used -- params is an ordering signal (D5), and
// precision bought by making the attribute depend on a second call that
// can fail is precision that costs the attribute.

// trained to emit a constrained tool call is a model trained to emit
// constrained JSON -- and it is the one that covers the operational class
// the spec names (llama3.1:8b, qwen2.5:7b both report it).
//
// It is deliberately conservative, per the package's fail-closed rule. An
// operator who disagrees about a specific model has a stated escape
// hatch rather than an argument with this heuristic: declare it under an
// OpenAI-compatible runtime pointed at Ollama's own /v1 surface, with
// structured_output: true. Their claim, their machine. That declaration
// now has to state tools: true as well if they want tool turns too --
// a declared entry WINS over this probe (resolveDuplicates), so an
// unstated attribute there is not inherited from here, it is lost.
//
// The same capability also answers Attributes.Tools directly, and the two
// reads are not a redundancy to collapse. Here they are one bit read
// twice because Ollama offers one capability that speaks to both; on a
// declared runtime they are two independent claims by the operator. A
