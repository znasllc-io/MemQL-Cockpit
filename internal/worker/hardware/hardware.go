// Package hardware is what this machine IS, reported as presence facts.
//
// The cluster cannot see any of it. The cockpit dials out from behind
// NAT and the engine reads what Register carries, so a machine that
// never says what it is has to be guessed at -- and the guess available
// is "derive it from the models advertised", which says nothing at all
// about the machine that has none. That machine is exactly the one this
// package exists for: a fresh worker, nothing pulled, about to be told
// which models it should have.
//
// Three rules run through it.
//
//   - PRESENCE FACTS ONLY. No serial numbers, no user names, no paths,
//     no hostname. This is not a style rule: the payload lands on a
//     registration row that the owner's whole cluster can read, so a
//     field added here is a field every reader of that row now has. The
//     field set is asserted by a test rather than reviewed, because
//     review is where "just this one path, for debugging" gets through.
//
//   - AN UNREADABLE FACT IS ABSENT, NEVER ZERO. Every probe may fail,
//     and a failure means "could not establish" -- which is a different
//     claim from establishing a zero. A memory size that came back
//     absent lets the engine read "this cockpit could not tell"; a
//     memory size of 0 tells it this machine has no memory, and the
//     class computed from that is wrong in the one direction that
//     matters.
//
//   - SCAN IS A PURE FUNCTION OF Probe, for the reason inference.Decide
//     is a pure function of Host: every platform question is answered by
//     a build-tagged file INTO the struct, so the rules fixture-test on
//     any CI runner rather than only on whichever one happens to match.
//     A runtime.GOOS inside Scan would put the Linux shape beyond the
//     reach of a Mac runner and the Mac shape beyond the reach of CI,
//     which is where a field that leaks a path survives to production.
