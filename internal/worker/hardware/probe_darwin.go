// runs on the Register path of a LaunchAgent, and a scan that forked
// `system_profiler` would put a multi-second stall in front of the
// worker's first connection on every start. `system_profiler
// SPHardwareDataType` would give a prettier chip string; it takes
// seconds and it is not worth them.
