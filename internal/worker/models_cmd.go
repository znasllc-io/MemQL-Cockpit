// exists: *why is my laptop not in the model list?* From the portal that
// has five plausible answers -- below the hardware floor, no runtime
// installed, not in models.allow, not signed in, simply asleep -- and all
// five render identically, as an absence. Only the machine can tell them
// apart, so the answer is printed here.
//
// It runs the SAME discovery the worker runs, so what it prints is what
// the cluster would be told. A second implementation could disagree with
// the first, and the operator would have no way to know which one lied.
