// TestNoCockpitCodePathNamesTheRetiredRoleEnum is memql-cockpit#403's second
// acceptance criterion, kept as a test rather than as a promise:
//
//	"No cockpit code path names the USER-ROLE-prefixed enum values, or
//	 compares the caller's cluster role to a legacy slug."
//
// (Paraphrased, because quoting the criterion verbatim would make this file
// match itself -- see the note on the needles below.)
//
// The criterion holds vacuously today: the 2026-08-25 slim-down deleted the
// TUI that used to read the enum, so there is nothing left to migrate. That is
// exactly why it is worth pinning. A vacuous truth is invisible, and the next
// person who needs the caller's role will find the generated getter for
// cluster_role sitting on the pinned proto, use it because it compiles, and
// put the cockpit back where the issue found it -- silently, because a cluster
// whose owner happens to hold one of the five predefined roles renders
// identically either way. It breaks only for the custom role the epic exists
// to serve, which is the case nobody tests by hand.
//
// The needles are assembled from fragments, and the prose above avoids them,
// so every Go file in the repository is scanned with NOTHING excluded --
// including this one. An exclusion list is how a guard like this quietly stops
// covering the file somebody actually edits.
